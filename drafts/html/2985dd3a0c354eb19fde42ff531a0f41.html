<p align="justify">In most laboratories, students simply follow the instructor in performing a series of tasks that they don&rsquo;t understand and perform the experiment without really knowing what the objectives are and what outcome is being sought. Virtual laboratories, in which experiments can be performed in a computer environment that include realistic elements of an actual laboratory, can help improve this important experience. Virtual tools can be used by the students to become familiar with the background, objectives, equipment, procedures, calculations, and the expected outcome of the experiment. As a result, the student may approach the actual hands-on experiment with more confidence and knowledge. If, because of unavailability of equipment or cost, the actual laboratory experience is not provided to the students, the virtual laboratory may be used as an alternative experience. The main objectives are to give the student exposure EM lab and to supplement the actual experiment with simulations and animations to give him better insight.</p>
