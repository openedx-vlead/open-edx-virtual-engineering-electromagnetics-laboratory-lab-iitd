<p align="justify">Physical distances and the availability of resources limit doing experiments, especially when they involve sophisticated instruments. Also, good teachers are always a scare resource. Web-based and video-based courses address the issue of teaching to some extent. Conducting joint experiments by two participating institutions and also sharing costly resources have always been a challenge. With the present day internet and computer technologies the above limitations need not limit students and researchers in enhancing their skills. Also, in a country such as ours, costly instruments and equipment need to be shared with fellow researchers to the extent possible. Web enabled experiments can be designed for remote operation and viewing so as to enthuse the curiosity and innovation of students. These would help in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.<br /><br /></p>
<p class="producthdr">To perform the experiments please download the following software:<br /><br /> <a href="http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/1383/lang/en"> LABVIEW RUNTIME ENGINE </a></p>
